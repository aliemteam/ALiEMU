        <h4>No Academic Credit</h4>
        <p>Unless otherwise explicitly indicated by a credit-granting institution, participation in or completion of a course does not confer any academic credit.

        <p>Excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief, for claims related to the Services where the total amount sought is less than ten thousand U.S. Dollars ($10,000.00 USD), either you or ALiEMU may elect at any point during the dispute to resolve the claim through binding, non-appearance-based arbitration.
